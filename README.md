# Simple-Calculator-in-C

--------------------------------------------------------------
Personal remake of a mini portable calculator

My code works this way -> rez = rez operation nr1 , where the operation can be + , - , * , /

To stop the calculator you can type any number you want , ( that is not gonna influence the result ) , and 's' , as example -> 2 s and the code will stop

I used CLion as compiler
